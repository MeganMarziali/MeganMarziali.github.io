### Research

My research to date has primarily focused on the impact of psychosocial factors on physical and mental well-being. I have explored the impact of social isolation on mortality among people living with HIV, and investigated the mediating role of depression on the relationship between loneliness and self-rated physical health. I have since begun researching the impact of social support and adolescent-confidant relationships on the relationship between perceived disapproval of substance use and actual adolescent substance use. I aim to continue exploring the role that social support and social networks play on substance use and mental health outcomes.

### About

I obtained a BSc. in Microbiology & Immunology from the [University of Britsh Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in 2018. I will graduate in 2021 with an MPH from the [Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/), where I continue to study Epidemiology with a certificate in Advanced Epidemiology.
